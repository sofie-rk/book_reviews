        review: "Murder in Little Egypt is a true crime, telling the story of the unimaginable crime of a father murdering his son. \
                Dr. Cavaness was a well respected doctor living in a small, rural place called Eldorado in Southern Illinois. Despite him being a greedy, drunken, and selfish man, the townpeople of Eldorado worshiped him. He had 4 sons, Mark, Kevin, Sean and Patrick.\
                Murder in Little Egyot is a story of manipulation, hatred, coldness and inhumanity. In the beginning, the reader gets a thourghough introduction to Dr. Cavaness life, long before he murdered his son.\
                I would recommend this book for those interested in true crime. The book is written on a detective and interpersonal level, without too many gory details.\

                April 4th 1991, Tom, Julie and Robin went for a late-night walk on the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge outside of St. Louis, Missouri. \
                On the bridge, they met Marlin Gray, Antonio Richardson, Reginald Clemsons and Daniel Winfrey, who robbed, assaulted and pushed them from the bridge. \
                A Rip in Heaven is a memoir of a shocking crime and its aftermath. It's impeccably written, and the author does an excellent job of respectfully telling a story that needed to be told. \
                I must say that I truly enjoyed reading the book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes true crime and memoirs.",

        review: "I was not a big Stassi fan after her first appereances on Vanderpump Rules. Although I grew to like her eventually, I did not expect to enjoy her book as much as I did. \
                As the book title implies, this book is about embracing being basic a.f. \
                A basic bitch loves all things Starbucks, selfies, social media, hot dogs, bubbly coctails, #OOTD, millenial pink... The list goes on and on. Basically, she covers every imaginable basic subject. \
                Stassi is bright, witty and authenic. It is easy entertainment, and I must shamefully admit that I enjoyed each and every part of it. \
                What I love the most about the book, though, is how empowering it is. When Stassi tells you to be basic a.f. she means that you should embrace being yourself. \
                Find your own style, learn from your mistakes, and find the people that love and support you. \
                \"Think of times you have felt your happiest, and make a list of them. And then take some time to think about why you were happy. \
                Yes, sometimes it will be because you were with loved ones or it was your 21st birthday or your son was born. \
                But a lot of them will be simply because you were yourself. And you would not having to pretend to be a foodie who despises hotdogs or a TV hater who would never watch Kardashians, even though you watch it on the reg. \
                Look to those moments and aspire to keep those moments going. And that's what makes you an enlightened next level basic bitch badass.\"\

        Harris shares some stories of her personal life, from growing up to studing to getting into politics to meeting her husband etc.\
        However, most of the book is centered around her career, and for a regular non-american person like me is this part too long, too detalied and difficult to follow. \
        I also felt that this book was too long and that the chapters were poorly structured. \
        I will give Harris another chance if she writes other books in the future, because I am sure she has a very interesting and important story to tell.\

        She plays the iconic \"Lorelai Gilmore\" in the TV-series \"Gilmore Girls\" which aired for seven seasons between 2000-2007.\
        I was late to the party and watched the show for the first time in 2017. I became obsessively in love with everything about it, and in just a few years I've rewatched the show several times.\
        I guess I was in desperate need of somthing to satisfy the big Stars-Hollow shaped hole in my life. Unfortunatley, this book wasn't enough to do so.\
        Lauren Graham seems like a wonderful woman, but I couldn't help but wanting her to be Lorelai Gilmore instead. \
        Although I enjoyed her reflections on Gilmore Girls and being Lorelai Gilmore, it was not enough to make this an amazing book.\
        I would easily listen to her for hours describing how it was to do each an every episosde, so maybe this book would never contain enough details to make me happy.\

        husbands create an extra seven hours of housework a week for women.\" \

        I read this book after recommendations from audible and goodreads based on my previous truecrime readings and after seeing the good reviews.\
        Unfortunately, this did not enter one of my favorite books.\
        \"We Througt We Knew You\" is a true story about the murder of Mary Yoder, a chiropractor operating a chiropractic center with her husband Bill.\
        One day she comes home unwell, suddendly vomiting and weak. She dies at the hospital, and it is later discovered that she had been poisoned with colchicine. \
        The story follows Adam Yoder, Bill and Mary's son, and his on-and-off girlfriend Kaitlyn Conley, who worked at the chiropractic center with Bill and Mary.\
        Spolier alert: Kaitlyn poisoned Mary. \
        Although the story is truly sad and unreal, I was never shocked by unknown twists. \
        The writing style did also not work well for me. Phelps jumps back and forth in time, and I struggled with understanding the circumstances around all of the fights between Adam and Kaitlyn.\
        It is unnessecary repetitive, and I think it could have been easily shorten to half.\
