    review: "Murder in Little Egypt is a true crime, telling the story of the unimaginable crime of a father murdering his son. \
            Dr. Cavaness was a well respected doctor living in a small, rural place called Eldorado in Southern Illinois. Despite him being a greedy, drunken, and selfish man, the townpeople of Eldorado worshiped him. He had 4 sons, Mark, Kevin, Sean and Patrick.\
            Murder in Little Egyot is a story of manipulation, hatred, coldness and inhumanity. In the beginning, the reader gets a thourghough introduction to Dr. Cavaness life, long before he murdered his son.\
            I would recommend this book for those interested in true crime. The book is written on a detective and interpersonal level, without too many gory details.\

    review: "A Rip in Heaven is Jeanine Cummins' story of a horrifying night when her cousins Julie and Robin Kerry and her brother Tom Cummins were brutally assualted. \
            April 4th 1991, Tom, Julie and Robin went for a late-night walk on the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge outside of St. Louis, Missouri. \
            On the bridge, they met Marlin Gray, Antonio Richardson, Reginald Clemsons and Daniel Winfrey, who robbed, assaulted and pushed them from the bridge. \
            A Rip in Heaven is a memoir of a shocking crime and its aftermath. It's impeccably written, and the author does an excellent job of respectfully telling a story that needed to be told. \
            I must say that I truly enjoyed reading the book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes true crime and memoirs.",
