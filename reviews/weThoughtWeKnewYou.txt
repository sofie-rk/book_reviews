Not impressed.
I read this book after recommendations from audible and goodreads based on my previous truecrime readings and after seeing the good reviews.
Unfortunately, this did not enter one of my favorite books.
"We Througt We Knew You" is a true story about the murder of Mary Yoder, a chiropractor operating a chiropractic center with her husband Bill.
One day she comes home unwell, suddendly vomiting and weak. She dies at the hospital, and it is later discovered that she had been poisoned with colchicine.
The story follows Adam Yoder, Bill and Mary's son, and his on-and-off girlfriend Kaitlyn Conley, who worked at the chiropractic center with Bill and Mary.
Spolier alert: Kaitlyn poisoned Mary. 
Although the story is truly sad and unreal, I was never shocked by unknown twists. 
The writing style did also not work well for me. Phelps jumps back and forth in time, and I struggled with understanding the circumstances around all of the fights between Adam and Kaitlyn.
It is unnessecary repetitive, and I think it could have been easily shorten to half.
Not a must-read from my side.
