Murder in Little Egypt is a true crime, telling the story of the unimaginable crime of a father murdering his son in. 

Dr. Cavaness was a well respected doctor living in a small, rural place called Eldorado in Southern Illinois. Despite him being a greedy, drunken, and selfish man, the townpeople of Eldorado worshiped him. He had 4 sons, Mark, Kevin, Sean and Patrick.

Murder in Little Egyot is a story of manipulation, hatred, coldness and inhumanity. In the beginning, the reader gets a thourghough introduction to Dr. Cavaness life, long before he murdered his son.

I would recommend this book for thos interested in true crime. The book is written on a detective and interpersonal level, without too many gory details.
