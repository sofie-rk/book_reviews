I truly love everything with Gilmore Girls.@

I guess 4 hours and 35 minutes wasn't long enough for me to change my view from Lorelai Gilmore to Lauren Graham.

She seems like a wonderful women, but I couldn't help but wanting her to be Lorelai Gilmore instead.

I read this book in two days. 

She shares stories about life, love and life in Hollywood.

Growing up, how she became an acteress.

She sits down and reflects on being cast as the fast-talking Lorelai Gilmore.

In "Talking as Fast a I Can", Lauren Graham shares stories about her life growing up, becoming an actress and living in Hollywood.

She plays the iconic "Lorelai Gilmore" in the TV-series "Gilmore Girls" which aired for seven seasons between 2000-2007.

I was late to the party and watched the show for the first time in 2017. I became obsessively in love with everything about it, and in just a few years I've rewatched the show several times.

I guess I was in desperate need of somthing to satisfy the big Stars-Hollow shaped hole in my life. Unfortunatley, this book wasn't enough to do so.

Lauren Graham seems like a wonderful woman, but I couldn't help but wanting her to be Lorelai Gilmore instead. 

Although I enjoyed her reflections on Gilmore Girls and being Lorelai Gilmore, it was not enough to make this an amazing book.

I would easily listen to her for hours describing how it was to do each an every episosde, so maybe this book would never contain enough details to make me happy.

I'm glad I read (I even finished it in 2 days), and I really couldn't not read it given how much I love Gilmore Girls.
