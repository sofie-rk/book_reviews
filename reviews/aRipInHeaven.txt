This is a memoir of a shocking crime and its aftermath.

It's about the family of the victims who won't forget.

It focuses on Tom Cummins, who was not only the victim of this particular crim, but also spent time as the chief suspect.


A Rip in Heaven is Jeanine Cummins' story of a horrifying night when her cousins Julie and Robin Kerry and her brother Tom Cummins were brutally assualted. 

April 4th 1991, Tom, Julie and Robin went for a late-night walk on the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge outside of St. Louis, Missouri.

On the bridge, they met Marlin Gray, Antonio Richardson, Reginald Clemsons and Daniel Winfrey, who robbed, assaulted and pushed them from the bridge.

A Rip in Heaven is a memoir of a shocking crime and its aftermath. It's impeccably written, and the author does an excellent job of respectfully telling a story that needed to be told.

I must say that I truly enjoyed reading the book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes true crime and memoirs.
